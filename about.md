Hi there!

You are probably wondering about how to pronounce my name. Here is the formula:

`Tipparat == `

* `'tip' + `
* `('pa' as 'papa' but longer sound) + `
* `('rat' as 'cut' with the '-r' sound)`

To avoid all of the trouble pronouncing my name, you could just call me `Tipp`.

I grew up in Thailand and came to the US when I was 15 years old. I am a 3rd year student at the University of Texas at Austin, studying Computer Science and Computational Biology. Currently, I am working as an undergraduate research associate with Dr. James Carson at Texas Advance Computing Center.
