<p>Hello World,</p>

<p>On Monday, we learned about iteration and function in JavaScript. I really like how Professor Downing taught us by comparing with the iteration of Python. I have a better understanding of JavaScript functions and iterations. However, I still need to code more in JavaScript so that I will understand it better. </p>

<p>On Wednesday, we started learning about database. Mostly, the implementations of “SELECT”, “PROJECT”, “CROSSJOIN”, and “THETAJOIN” in Python. I had an experience with MySQL before from my Database Management class. However, we learned how to use those procedure calls not the implementation of it. Learning about the implementation makes me appreciate the query language more. </p>

<p>We started working on the second phase of the project. I finally got to use my database knowledge! Our group decided to use sqlalchemy and postgresql for our database backend. We have to revamp our models.py to use the actual database not the pretend database (static json file) we had before. The actual database implementation was not bad. However, the installation of different dependencies of the packages are quite time consuming. One little tip is to write down the command line that works for your installation so that other members in the group can use it. Sqlalchemy works really well with Flask. Postgress app really helps to visualize the database we have. It uses the same instructions and structures as mySQL. I learn several tools, tricks, and lessons from my teammates. I am glad that I get to work with them and learn from them.</p>

<p>I learned about Pycharm. It is basically Eclipse for Python. The application has a great debugging tool. It saves me a lot of time when debugging with my Python code. The other tool I learned was Google Chrome’s Inspect Element. It really helps me to redesign our webpages and debug our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. It even helps with the view for different mobile devices.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pycharm is nice with Python, especially for debugging. They have a free education one!</li>
  <li>Chrome’s Inspect Element for HTML, CSS, js debugging!</li>
