<p>Hello World,</p>

<p>I started off my first blog with “Hello World” because of two reasons: 1) the blog is published to the world; 2) generally it is the first thing we learned when we first programmed. </p>

<p>On the first day of class, I felt overwhelming yet challenging by the amount of tools we have to learn within this 9-week class. Without knowing it, the first week passed by quickly and we already touched on <code>Mocha</code>, <code>UnitTest</code>, <code>Istanbul</code>, <code>Coverage</code>, <code>Travis CI</code>, and <code>PyDoc</code>. Though I have never used majority of these tools before, I started to incorporate them with my personal projects. I really like how the class is very practical that once I got home from the class, I can play with my new tools and toys that improve my codes.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that I got a little bit nervous when professor Downing called me out in class this week, I learned to be more confident in my answer. In addition, I began to like how he called people out in class since it keeps everyone engaging and participating. It created a learning environment where everybody has to pay attention and to follow the train of thought at all time. </p>

<p>I have been using <code>Python 2.7</code> for 3 years and now it is time for me to distinguish between <code>Python-2</code> and <code>Python-3</code>. I found this <a href="http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/imprint_downloads/informit/promotions/python/python2python3.pdf">cheat sheet</a> useful whenever I get a syntax error or an exception. </p>

<p>TravisCI is a continuous integration tool used to test the project. I have never used it before. In order to connect the private github repository with TravisCI, you have to go to <a href="https://magnum.travis-ci.com/">https://magnum.travis-ci.com/</a> instead of <a href="https://travis-ci.org/profile/">https://travis-ci.org/profile/</a>. I have gone through the struggle of successfully build at travis-ci because of this <code>sudo: setuid root</code> error. This error occurs because the sudo access has turned off on TravisCI Docker side for student package. The fix is very simple by adding this <code>sudo: required</code> to <code>.travis.yml</code> file. I read the information about this error from <a href="https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/2862">travis-ci issue</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26299552/travis-sudo-is-disabled">stackoverflow</a>.</p>

<p>Even though it is only the first week of class, I have learned many practical things. Time really flies fast. In the end, I really think this class will be a worthwile experience for me. Thanks for reading!</p>

  <li>Add <code>sudo: required</code> to <code>.travis.yml</code> when you have <code>sudo: setuid root</code> error because of the student package limitation</li>
  <li>If you already hosted your website using <code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code>, you can make a new repository for your blog and create a <code>gh-pages</code> branch to have your own blog hosting separately from your actual website. In addition, you can also create a github page for your project by doing the same thing! <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/">Here’s how!</a></li>
