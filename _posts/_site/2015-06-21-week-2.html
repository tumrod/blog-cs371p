<p>Hello World,</p>

<p>Time starts to fly real fast! Several materials were covered in class this week, from iterator and iterable to different types of Python data structures. I really like how I now understand more about the language and its upside. Python is really clever about list comprehension and several one line for loop. This weekâ€™s class gave me different data structures in Python that can be used to improve the efficiency of my code. <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code>, and <code>lambda</code> were relatively new idea to me. However, Professor Downing taught them with a comparison method, which betters understanding me.</p>

<p>The first couple weeks of classes, I have been doing pretty badly with the quizzes because of its time constraint and my nervousness with TopHat.com. However, I have seen my improvements each day. I started to make a little review/summary sheet after each class and I think that really helps me to keep up with the materials. I would review them during an hour break before the class to refresh my learning about previous lectures. I think this little tip helps me with the quiz improvement.</p>

<p>Professor Downing assigned many interesting and useful papers. I like the facts that they are applicable to a real world workplace, for example pair programming and the art of agile. Those papers taught you how to be a better programmer/developer.</p>

<p>The project for this week was a Netflix rating prediction. We have to write everything from scratch but it was a good learning experience. I started to love json dictionary from this project. Prediction is one of the areas I have wanted to learn because data science and data mining start to play a major role in our life. I better go back to my project and improve its root mean square error. Thanks for reading!</p>

<h2 id="tips-of-the-week">tips-of-the-week</h2>

<ul>
  <li>make a summary chart after each lecture by comparing either between data structures or between languages</li>
  <li>print the code prior to class so you can follow along with Professor Downing</li>
</ul>
