<p>Hello World,</p>

<p>This week has gone by quickly! The assigned readings for this week are interesting and thought provoking. The common theme for these papers are enormous disaster from small simple errors from the code. Ariane 5, a gigantic rocket, exploded after it launched because of a computer program tried to put a 64-bit number into a 16-bit space. Of course, overflow error! Another case is the Patriot Missile that has a roundoff error. Programmers really need to be detail-oriented because maybe one single integer can determine life and death situation. Every single line of code is important and should be examined throughly.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, we have Everett Toews from Rackspace as a guest speaker. He described how openStack work because Rackspace is pretty much an OpenStack with other additional services. We will be using Rackspace for our three-phase group project. I actually am excited about it. I can foresee that I will learn a lot of things from the projects and the group. Learning by doing is really fun and worthwhile experience.</p>

<p>On Friday, we got to create an iterator and a generator from scratch! It helps me understand more about how iterator and generator work. Today I went to meet with a study group for test 1 tomorrow. I wrote some practice problems for the test for different topics from list comprehensions, dict comprehension, exceptions, generators, iterators, to lambda function. I learned a lot from writing those questions because some of them required some research for extra information. In addition, the questions I wrote are also from my curiosity about how the outcome might be if I tried this function instead of that function. The group I met today was awesome as well because they prepared several great questions that helped me understanding more about the test materials. Creating questions already is difficult. However, explaning the solution step by step is even more difficult. I learned a great deal from explaning the solution I wrote. Forming a study group is also great to confirm several ideas that I was unsured about. In addition, some of the solutions has an alternative so I can expand my knowledge from taking the suggestion from the group. </p>

<p>I started using iPython notebook after failing the installation several times. However, I can use it now to prepare myself for the test tomorrow. Though I feel prepared, I still think that I have to study more and even be prepared for more challenging questions. I think I will write some more questions and redo all of the question sets I have to make sure that I actually understand everything.</p>

  <li>Forming a study group, writing test questions, and taking each other’s test</li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://gist.github.com/">gist.github</a> to share your Ipython notebook so you don’t have to put them in a repository</li>
  <li>Using <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/">nbviewer</a> to view your Ipython notebook from gist: here is my <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/tumrod/6202e7c5aece38d62272/q1_dict.ipynb">example</a></li>
