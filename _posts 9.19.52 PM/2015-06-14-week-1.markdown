Hello World,

I started off my first blog with “Hello World” because of two reasons: 1) the blog is published to the world; 2) generally it is the first thing we learned when we first programmed. 

On the first day of class, I felt overwhelming yet challenging by the amount of tools we have to learn within this 9-week class. Without knowing it, the first week passed by quickly and we already touched on `Mocha`, `UnitTest`, `Istanbul`, `Coverage`, `Travis CI`, and `PyDoc`. Though I have never used majority of these tools before, I started to incorporate them with my personal projects. I really like how the class is very practical that once I got home from the class, I can play with my new tools and toys that improve my codes.

Despite the fact that I got a little bit nervous when professor Downing called me out in class this week, I learned to be more confident in my answer. In addition, I began to like how he called people out in class since it keeps everyone engaging and participating. It created a learning environment where everybody has to pay attention and to follow the train of thought at all time. 

I have been using `Python 2.7` for 3 years and now it is time for me to distinguish between `Python-2` and `Python-3`. I found this [cheat sheet][py2py3] useful whenever I get a syntax error or an exception. 

TravisCI is a continuous integration tool used to test the project. I have never used it before. In order to connect the private github repository with TravisCI, you have to go to [https://magnum.travis-ci.com/][travis1] instead of [https://travis-ci.org/profile/][travis2]. I have gone through the struggle of successfully build at travis-ci because of this `sudo: setuid root` error. This error occurs because the sudo access has turned off on TravisCI Docker side for student package. The fix is very simple by adding this `sudo: required` to `.travis.yml` file. I read the information about this error from [travis-ci issue][issue] and [stackoverflow][stack].

Even though it is only the first week of class, I have learned many practical things. Time really flies fast. In the end, I really think this class will be a worthwile experience for me. Thanks for reading!

##tips-of-the-week

* [learn git with this cheat sheet][gh-cheat]

{% highlight text %}

$ git status
$ git add -A . #this will add all of the tracked and untracked files
$ git commit -m "commit message"
$ git push origin branch_name

{% endhighlight %}

* [Python-2 VS Python-3 cheat sheet][py2py3]
* Add `sudo: required` to `.travis.yml` when you have `sudo: setuid root` error because of the student package limitation
* If you already hosted your website using `<username>.github.io`, you can make a new repository for your blog and create a `gh-pages` branch to have your own blog hosting separately from your actual website. In addition, you can also create a github page for your project by doing the same thing! [Here's how!][gh]
