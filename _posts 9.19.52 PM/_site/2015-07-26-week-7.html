<p>Hello World,</p>

<p>This will be my last post for the Software Engineering blog. However, it will not be my last post blog about what I learn for sure, especially I started my personal learning project called “learn-new-thing-everyday.” I actually am excited about this project.</p>

<p>Software Engineering class is probably the best class I have taken at UT. At least, it is now my new favorite class. It is a worthwhile learning experiences from the meaning and functionality behinds the code to the actual application of it. My knowledge of Python has increased significantly. Previously, I would just know how to code in Python but not actually the pros/cons of different data structures. Prior to this class, I have been using list and dictionary for couple years without knowing about the generators. I am planning to revamp my old Python script for my bisque-lungMap project to have a better code structure. I also like to apply several tools we used for class, for example, coverage, Travis CI, Pydoc, unittest, and iPython notebook, to the project as well.</p>

<p>Here is the summary of the class:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Week: 9 Weeks</li>
  <li>
    <p>Lectures: 14 lectures + 3 guest lectures + 2 presentation days
  Since it is a 9-week summer session class, the class went pretty fast. We meet about 1 hour and 45 minutes every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Though the class is almost 2 hours long, I often feel like it is only about an hour. For each lecture, Professor Downing explained the Python code line by line, by calling out a student from his “randomized” list to explain the snippet of code, then he will add his formalized explanaion to the student’s answer. </p>

    <p>Normally, I would expect him to call me out every week. To reduce the chance of getting call in class, you should attend every class, participate on Piazza (like reading, answering), and try to do well on the quizzes, exams, and projects. Earlier in the semester, I did not do well on the quizzes and the first project. I got 40% deducted from breaking the grader’s script by turning in the wrong url format on the Google form and I missed the deadline for resubmition. It definitely hurt my initial grade. I was ranked like 50 out 60 students. I feel like I got called more often back then. I recovered from the first project grade after the first exam and the second project. My rank has improved from 50 to 22. I definitely feel better about that. I still got called in class but it is not as often as before. Then, my rank has improved again from 22 to 12. I am content and satisfy with the improvement I made.</p>

    <p>We also have 3 guest lecturers from different companies. They are software engineers from the industry. They talked about what they do at work. It helps me vision what I will be doing in real life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exercises: 
  Professor Downing will have exercises during the class. You will write a snippet of Python code with a partner. You do not have to turn it in, it is for your own learning experience. I like how we can have a break from listening to the lecture by interacting with other students from doing the exercises.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quizzes: 18 quizzes + drop 3 quizzes
  We used Top Hat for quizzes. It is similar to iClicker but fancier because Top Hat shows real-time attendance and grading records and reviews for quizzes. The quizzes required you to think on your feet in a small amount of time. Earlier in the semester, I struggled with the quizzes because of the time constraint. However, you could ask him to go back to the question or tell him that you are not done yet. He is really nice to wait for everyone to complete the questions. Be prepared to read the assigned readings and review the previous class materials.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Projects: 5 projects (2 individual + 1 (3-phases) group project)
  The first two projects are individual projects. They really prepared you well for the 3-phase project since they touched on different basic tools, like Github, Travis CI, unittest, and coverage. The other 3 projects are actually one large project with different phases. Yes, they are built on top of each other. Yes, they are group project. One tip: Choose your teammate wisely by forming a group with different skillsets of people. I am lucky to have great teammates. They have taught me different tools I can use. They are great collaborators. We did well for the projects because we started really early and attempted to finish before the due date about 1-2 days. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tests: 2 exams
  The first exam is mostly implementation of different functions we have learned in class. Professor Downing did give the hint on his review day. He also allowed an 8 x 11 note for the test (with no code). Tips: Forming a study group with other students, Making the practice exams and taking others’ practice exams. I definitely learn more when I tried to explain something to other people. </p>

    <p>We are going to have a second exam tomorrow.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I really like the class. Professor Downing is a good lecturer. The course itself is really well organized and structured. I definitely recommend you to take this class. You will learn differet tools for Software Development. The class is not an easy class but it teaches you several things. It is definitely one of the class where you can apply everything you learned from class to your own personal projects. Take it. Experience it. Learn it. </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

  <li>We have to upload our presentation to Speaker Deck for the 3-phase project presentation. However, I encourage you to learn from other people’s presentation, too. I indeed got an inspiration to do my “learn-new-thing-everyday” project from one of the presentation. The author did a “52-weeks-52-projects” project.</li>
